## About
<p>
  Cozy Fishing Game is inspired by Stardew Valley fishing mini-game, which is my favorite mechanic in the game. 
</p>
<p>
During development I have:
<ul>
  <li> Implemented the game loop using the <b>State Machine</b> pattern </li>
  <li> Used the <b>Unity Animations</b> for frame-by-frame animations </li>
  <li> Used the <b>DOTween</b> package for quick and simple animations </li>
  <li> Created <b>Unit Tests</b> in Edit Mode </li>
  <li> Created assets in a <b>pixel art</b> style </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  I only use free assets for sound. Here's the links: <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/ambient/nature/nature-essentials-208227#description">ambient</a>, <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/foley/water-splash-pack-14039">splashes</a>

## How to Play
<p>
  Help a cute fisherman to catch fish at his favorite spot!
</p>
<p>
  To cast the fishing rod, press and hold anywhere on the screen (either with your finger or the left mouse button). An indicator will appear, showing how far you'll cast the rod. Release your finger or mouse button when the bar is closest to the right edge of the indicator — the closer it is to the right, the higher the chance of catching a rare fish!

<p>
  Wait for the fish to bite. As soon as the "PULL" message appears, tap anywhere on the screen. Don't miss the moment! <br>

<p>
  Once the fish is hooked, the real challenge begins — reeling it in! A special menu will appear on the left side of the screen. Your task is to keep the green rectangle aligned with the fish until the bar on the right fills up. While pressing on the screen, the rectangle rises, and when you release, it falls. You'll need to be a skilled fisherman because if the bar on the right drops to zero, the fish will escape!
